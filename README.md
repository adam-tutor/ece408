Opt0 - Baseline
    This "optimization" is the only one to contain all of the original source code; this is the baseline that all of the others are built off of. Subsequent optimizations will only be including the student_code/custom/new-forward.cu file, which is the one performing the convolution.
Opt1 - Tiled Shared Matrix
Opt2 - Matrix Multiplication
Opt4 - Constant Memory
Opt5 - Tuning Restrict
Opt6 - Sweeping
Opt10 - FP16
